# Welcome, Dwellers!
If you're part of my D&D group, then you've found a wiki on the lore of the
land. If you're not? Then you have no purpose being here; turn back now, as from
here on out I'll be assuming you _do_.

## Navigating
Look up.

## Contributing
See an obvious error? Like spelling or something? Seriously, I edit this in a
code editor. There isn't an English spellcheck. I also have awful memory. So,
go edit things [right here](https://papayaman1000.github.com/campaign-wiki).

You can add new pages there, too. Make sure you yell at me whenever you propose
a change so I can update the repository in a timely manner.

But yeah. There's category tabs up top, go read about things. Demonstrating
knowledge of the land's lore can be incredibly helpful. ***Hint, hint.***
