# The Dwarven Kingdom of Gond

**The Dwarven Kingdom of Gond**, often shortened to The Kingdom of Gond or
Gond's Realm, is a small nation in the northwest mountains of
[Eidos](pages/regions/kingdoms/eidos.md).

## Regions

The Dwarven Kingdom is quite the miniscule country, nestled exclusively within
the [Banesjaw Peaks](pages/regions/banesjaw_peaks.md) mountain range.

## Relations

The Kingdom of Gond is completely neutral, and rather isolated. It welcomes
travelers and traders alike with open arms, but barring rare materials and
special orders, the denizens rarely purchase anything, instead preferring to
extract things from the mountains themselves. However, the Artisan Nation does
frequently export magnificent works of smithery, both of general production and
the occasional grand commission. The country rarely fights in wars, only taking
up arms to ward its own lands or help fell a truly atrocious foe.

## Current state

The Kingdom is as industrious and merry as ever, clanging away at magnificent
masterworks of modern metallurgy. They rarely fall into recession, especially
with the two neighboring nations constantly being at each other's throats.

## History

Gond's Realm has been consistent throughout history, forming as an extension of
several dwarf-populated crafting guilds before the continent was wholly settled.
Very few have attempted to assault their lands, and none have been successful,
as the hardy dwarves with their advanced war machines and the protection of the
mountains themselves makes it just too much effort to lay siege to the small,
stalwart kingdom of the Peaks.
