# Xuoid

The Vast Expanse, Xuoid, is a barren and frigid land that encircles the world.
It's comprised of deep-frozen ice plains and large plateaus. The land is
constantly stripped by incredibly strong winds, the likes of which could send a
Titan tumbling. The snowfall is so heavy that everything beyond forearm's length
is completely whited out. Nobody who has trekked in has ever returned.

Some scholars speculate that the far reaches of Xuoid seamlessly transition into
another plane, but getting them to agree which one is akin to routing an Orcish
horde.
