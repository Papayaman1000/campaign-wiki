# Summersong

**Summersong** is a kingdom that controls the northern and eastern lands of
[Eidos](pages/regions/kingdoms/eidos.md).

## Regions

These regions fall within Summersong's borders:
  * [The Northern Plains](pages/regions/plains_north.md)
  * [Mycogrove](pages/regions/mycogrove.md)
  * [The Worldwound](pages/regions/worldwound.md)
  * [Banesjaw Peaks](pages/regions/banesjaw_peaks.md)
    [Northern half of southern tip]
  * [Chauntea's Bounty](pages/regions/chaunteas_bounty.md) [Northeastern half]

## Relations

Summersong is warring with the nation of
[Glyphshire](pages/regions/kingdoms/glyphshire.md) over the potently fertile
lands of Chauntea's Bounty; despite this, many traders and travelers alike
frequently cross between the two. Aside from this, the nation is fairly
isolationist, keeping most of its trade within its own borders, and generally
remaining neutral in the wars of other countries.

## Current State

Due to their being northeast of the mountains, Summersong has very little
fertile land away from the border, compared to Glyphshire. As such, the nation's
people are frequently starving. Rumors have spread of a rising revolution.
