# Summersong

**Summersong** is a kingdom that controls the northern and eastern lands of
[Eidos](#!pages/regions/eidos.md).

## Regions

These regions fall within Summersong's borders:
  * [The Northern Plains](#!pages/regions/plains_north.md)
  * [Mycogrove](#!pages/regions/mycogrove.md)
  * [The Worldwound](#!pages/regions/worldwound.md)
  * [Banesjaw Peaks](#!pages/regions/banesjaw_peaks.md) [Northern border]
  * [Chauntea's Bounty](#!pages/regions/chaunteas_bounty.md) [Northeastern half]

## Relations

Summersong is warring with the nation of
[Glyphshire](glyphshire.md) over the potently fertile
lands of Chauntea's Bounty; despite this, many traders and travelers alike
frequently cross between the two. Aside from this, the nation is fairly
isolationist, keeping most of its trade within its own borders, and generally
remaining neutral in the wars of other countries.

## Current State

Due to their being northeast of the mountains, Summersong has very little
fertile land away from the border, compared to Glyphshire. As such, the nation's
people are frequently starving. Rumors have spread of a rising revolution.

## History

Summersong was formed roughly 300 years ago, a short while after Glyphshire.
Almost immediately, Chauntea's Bounty became a point of contention for it and
its neighbor, and they soon began warring over it, a battle that still persists
today. Most of the populous has remained quite critical of this war, as
Glyphshire has no interest in counterattacking Summersong, so the nation would
be left with perfectly farmable (and incredibly bountiful) land should they halt
their advance now. However, the nation's leaders, who, throughout history, have
traditionally held major stakes in these wars, refuse to do so.
