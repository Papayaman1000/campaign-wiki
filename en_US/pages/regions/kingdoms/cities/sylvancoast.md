# Sylvancoast

**Sylvancoast** is the capital of, and largest city in, the kingdom of
[Glyphshire](#!pages/regions/kingdoms/glyphshire.md).

## History

Sylvancoast began as a small port town along the south of
[The Grand Partition](#!pages/regions/grand_partition.md), and, as port towns
wont to do, summarily exploded in population and business. Nowadays, it's a
bustling urban epicenter with everything an adventurer could ever need.
