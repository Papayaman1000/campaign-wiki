# Glyphshire

**Glyphshire** is a kingdom that controls the southern and western lands of
[Eidos](#!pages/regions/continents/eidos.md).

## Regions

These regions fall under the jurisdiction of Glyphshire:

  * [The Southern Plains](#!pages/regions/plains_south.md)  
  * [The Western Plains](#!pages/regions/plains_west.md)  
  * [Valenwood](#!pages/regions/valenwood.md)  
  * [Banesjaw Peaks](#!pages/regions/banesjaw_peaks.md) [Southern border]  
  * [Chauntea's Bounty](#!pages/regions/chaunteas_bounty.md) [Southwestern half]

## Current State

Glyphshire is quite prosperous, controlling the majority of Eidos' fertile land,
and always fighting a deadlock war with [Summersong](summersong.md) for more.
While the populace aren't all fattened on wine and honey, you still don't see
quite as many people starving in the streets. Glyphshire has an attraction for
those of magical inclination, hosting a large number of colleges, guilds,
orders, brotherhoods, and so on devoted to magecraft of all sorts. The wizards
work to further arcane technology; druids, to preserve the wilds and bolster
food growth; clerics, to provide protection and guidance to the meek; and many
other sects, their own goals. Many argue that the healthy concentration on magic
within Glyphshire's borders has a lot more to do with its prosperity than its
success at early landgrabs back when Eidos was first settled.

## History

Glyphshire was formed roughly 350 years ago, around when Eidos was first
settled. Not very long later, it began minor skirmishes with the equally-young
Summersong over Chauntea's Bounty, a low-key war that's persisted to this day.
The nations do not despise each other; far from it, in fact, especially among
their peoples. Still, the Bounty is a major prize, and if either country
controls it in full, then they'll likely hold in their hands the greatest source
of agricultural production in the world. Until then, however, the land is
scarred and unused as war is fought over it, angering peasants and druids alike.
