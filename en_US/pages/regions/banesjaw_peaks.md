# Banesjaw Peaks

The **Banesjaw Peaks**, sometimes called just Banesjaw or The Maw of Bane, is a
resource-rich mountain chain on the continent of [Eidos](continents/eidos.md).

## History

The Peaks were never really contested. They form a natural barrier between the
two warring nations of [Glyphshire](kingdoms/glyphshire.md) and
[Summersong](kingdoms/summersong.md), and around the minute
[Kingdom of Gond](kingdoms/kingdom_of_gond.md). They also have a tendency to
block moisture from moving east, contributing to the growth of
[Valenwood](valenwood.md), and the crackling drought that developed
[the Worldwound](worldwound.md). The heart of the mountain range is rich with
minerals and resources, perfect for the dwarves of Gond's Realm.

## Legend

The mountain range is fabled to have fallen from the skull of Bane himself,
lending to its name. Such was told due to the disappearance of many travelers in
the mountains, though due to the overwhelming majority of these disappearances
being apprentices or craftsmen well on their way to mastery of artisan trades,
most were likely just the "victim" integrating with the Dwarves without
bothering to leave. Still, there's no such thing as a safe mountain range, so
one should still exercise caution when traversing the Peaks.
