# The Grand Partition

The Grand Partition is a combination of a dense ice floe and a massive, sudden
oceanic rift that prevents passage between the
[Southern Plains](regions/plains_south.md) and the
[Northern Plains](regions/plains_north.md) in the country of
[Faerun](regions/kingdoms/faerun.md).

## History

The Partition has been there for as long as anybody alive remembers. Many have
tried to brave the deadly waters, thinking its reputation to only be overblown
superstition. Not a single one of these sailors have made it across. Nowadays,
the majority of people sail around the northwestern end of the Partition,
where a small, rocky island holds a lighthouse and a resupply port.

## Legends

Some folk say that the Partition contains a massive sea monster. Others suggest
that the chasm holds a gate to some Outer Plane, such as Elemental Water or
the oceans of the Gith homeworld. Still more think it's a land sacred to some
god or another, and that any who pass through are struck with the strength of
the Divines themselves. They all agree one one thing, though: trying to cross
these waters spells naught but certain doom for any who attempt it.
