# Chauntea's Bounty

A coveted and highly fertile region, **Chauntea's Bounty** is a swath of highly
contested land that's often warred over between the nations of
[Glyphshire](kingdoms/glyphshire.md) and [Summersong](kingdoms/summersong.md).

## History

Ever since the two major nations of [Eidos](continents/eidos.md) were founded,
they've been fighting a continuous and bloody war over the Bounty. While the
trampling has been harmful to some of the vegetation, the massive amount of
blood and corpses helps to enrich the land even more, making it more valuable
and productive with each soldier slain. Additionally, some of the region still
has mystic connections with the [Valenwood](valenwood.md), and so many Druids
find the land to be quite valuable for how the various combinations of potent
natural energy combine to create quite the powerful boost to natural magics.

## Legend

Many proclaim that the Bounty is blessed by Chauntea herself, and soldiers in
the area are known to make small sacrifices in her name, thinking she pays extra
attention to the region. Meanwhile, many practitioners of magic claim that the
plains seem to radiate arcane energy in large amounts, too, which has led many
scholars to believe that the land there is densely packed with leylines. This,
of course, has led some mining groups into speculating whether or not it would
be more lucrative to dig it up. This has been met with quite a bit of pushback,
obviously, but the idea's out there.
