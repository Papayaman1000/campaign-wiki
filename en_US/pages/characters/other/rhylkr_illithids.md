# Mind Flayer Colony: Rhy'lk'thr

The Rhy'lk'thr colony is three miles due north of the Underdark Central Nexus of
[Eidos](#!pages/regions/continents/eidos.md). It occasionally captures workers
travelling into the adjacent tunnels and enthralls them. It recently traded a
slave for a larger and stronger one with a small coalition of explorers. He's
quite the potent creature, and his innate magical abilities make him ripe for
higher positions. He may soon be implanted with a tadpole to begin the
conversion -- nay, evolution -- into a new illithid.
