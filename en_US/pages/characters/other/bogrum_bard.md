# Bogrum, Bard of the Silver Dragon Saloon

He's not on their payroll or anything, it's just his favorite haunt. Tips are
good there, too.

He was recently robbed of his lute and some ale money by a subscum pickpocket,
whose half-hog consort smashed his temples in when he tried to raise objection.
Burly guy got him the house brew for his troubles, though, so no hard feelings,
eh? Still, lutes ain't cheap -- he could have a hell of a weekend carousing
around town with the cash he needs to replace it. It was his favorite, too! That
thing's survived a fall from Godsfang Summit with him! And-- bah, rambling
again. Whatever, just leave a decent tip next time, ya degenerates.
