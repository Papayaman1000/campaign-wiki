# Craig the Drow

His real name is different, but most of you don't speak Undercommon.

Craig lives in the Underdark Central Nexus of
[Eidos](#!pages/regions/continents/eidos.md). He's quite grateful for a small
band of wandering travellers helping to rescue his girlfriend from the clutches
of [a nearby Illithid colony](#!pages/characters/other/rhylkr_illithids.md).
He'll happily provide housing for them and their companions for an evening or
two should they find themselves in the area, so long as they don't mind a, ah,
noisy pair of roommates.

He also humbly requests you refrain from touching his stuff in the future.
