# Welcome to the wiki!

Hey there! If you're back here, you're probably thinking of editing something.
Please do! All of the wiki's content is stashed in the `en-US` folder as
Markdown (`*.md`) files. You should be familiar with basic Markdown from sites
like Reddit and Discord, but there's `cheatsheet.md` in the root here for
refreshers on everything from basic formatting to advanced quirks of the wiki
engine.

If you're feeling extra ambitious, you might even go install git and a site host
(such as [Fenix](http://fenixwebserver.com/)) to edit and preview this. It's
more likely that this page won't ever be seen by anyone but myself, but if
someone were to consider contributing, I'd be exceptionally happy to see that
initiative being taken! Honestly, though, it's most likely that I'm the only one
who'll touch this and all this documentation writing was a waste of time.
Whatever.
